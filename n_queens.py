###
# Approach:
# We use backtracking to place queens one row at a time.
# At each step, we try placing a queen in all columns of the current row.
# We maintain three sets to ensure safety:
# - cols: to check if a column already has a queen
# - pos_diag (r + c): to check positive diagonals
# - neg_diag (r - c): to check negative diagonals
# If a valid spot is found, place 'Q' and recurse for the next row.
# After recursion, we backtrack by removing the queen and updating sets.
# Once we reach row n, we convert the board to string format and add to results.
#
# Time Complexity: O(N!) - worst case trying all permutations with pruning
# Space Complexity: O(NÂ²) for the board, O(N) for recursion and sets
